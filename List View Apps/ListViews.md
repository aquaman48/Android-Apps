# Apps using a ListView

Using a ListView for the layout in Android was interesting. Compared to Master/Flow style layouts, ListViews are simple and to the point. As you see the screenshots down below, we are basically giving the user 3 options to choose from and with each option they see the results.


## City Guide App


## Beach Mountain Bike Rentals App

This app is a basic list app with 3 options for the user. The main menu is a ListView, the beach/mountain bikes are ImageViews, and the website is a WebView. Please see the screenshots below for the results.
