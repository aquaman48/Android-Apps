## Shared Preferences

When we request data from a user the best way to store that data so it is still available when the application is re-opened we can use `SharedPreferences`. The applications in this directory all use shared preferences.


### Electric Car Financing App

Here in this application we have a few different screens depending on user input. We have the main screen the user will first see once the application is open. Then the user will put in some inputs. They will provide how many years of the loan, the total, and the interest rate. Depending on how many years the user selects will determine which image is then displayed once they click the button.
