# Android Development using Java

Compiler used: **Android Studios** v.4.1.3 <br />
OS: **Microsoft Windows 10**

## Welcome 

Here is a big sandbox repository from building Android applications in Android Studio using Java. I know you can use Kotlin as well and maybe later on I will try making some applications with that instead. However, in the meantime I will continue to add on to this readme file and other files to help with documentation as I go along. 

## Highlights

Here are some of the Android Applications that I have worked on so far that a more "noteworthy" in my opinion. Like the ringtone sampler app that I worked on. It takes quite a few different concepts and puts them all together in one. 

- [Ringtone Sampler App](https://github.com/aquaman48/Android-Apps/blob/main/Button-Uses/BUTTONS.md#ringtone-sampler) (Audio)
- [Healthy Snacks](https://github.com/aquaman48/Android-Apps/blob/main/Grid%20View%20Apps/GridView.md#healthy-snacks) (GridView)
- [Beach and Mountain Bike Rental App](https://github.com/aquaman48/Android-Apps/blob/main/List%20View%20Apps/ListViews.md#beach-mountain-bike-rentals-app) (ListView)
- []() (Tablet View)
