# Android Development using Java

Compiler used: **Android Studios** v.4.1.3 <br />
OS: **Microsoft Windows 10**

## Welcome 

Here is a big sandbox repository from building Android applications in Android Studio using Java. I know you can use Kotlin as well and maybe later on I will try making some applications with that instead. However, in the meantime I will continue to add on to this readme file and other files to help with documentation as I go along. 

## Highlights

Here are some of the Android Applications that I have worked on so far that a more "noteworthy" in my opinion. Like the ringtone sampler app that I worked on. It takes quite a few different concepts and puts them all together in one.
