# Android Applications built for Tablets

Compiler used: **Android Studios** v.4.1.3 <br />
OS: **Microsoft Windows 10**

## Tablet Applications

In this directory I have created some applications for the Nexus 10 Android tablet device. With using a bigger screen we have more room to display things for an application. Like with lists or in the apps that I have created that use a DatePicker for the user to select a date and make reservations within the application. 


## Appalachian Trail Festival

Here you can see it is a horizontal layout and we display an image solely on the left side and on the right we show the rest of the information we want to get across. 


#### Main

As you can see the user can push a button and once it does the datepicker shows up.
