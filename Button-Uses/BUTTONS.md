# Basic Click-Buttons

In this directory I was working with implementing a button. In the Youth Hostel application that button was used to show more information once clicked. There a lot of various uses we can have for a button. The main uses of the button that I worked through in this directory is on click it will open a new page like in the Youth Hostel app or it could be what starts doing the calculations to find a price of a ticket for a ferry tickets and have them displayed like in the Catalina Island Express app. 


## Youth Hostel App

Once the application is opened and running in the emulator the main screen will look like this:

#### Results
As you can see that once the user clicks on the `Hostel Information` button they would then get redirected to the information page as seen here:



## Catlina Island Express App

This application uses a button as well but, in a different way. Here once the button is clicked then we see the result of the price of the ticket per number specified by user. 
Also, there is a use of a drop down list as well. This one was interesting with using Java in the background to complete the calculations.

# Radio Buttons

## Photo Prints App 

## Floor Tile App 

Here things get a little more complicated. Well, just in terms of the Java code anyway. This app is helping us find out how many 12x12 or 18x18 tiles we would need with user defined room dimensions.

# Buttons with Audio

These application makes use of using audio within a Android application. I did something different with these applications and implemented a splash screen in each of them. This splash screen is the first screen the user will see when running the application and will continue to the main activity after a set time. In most of the cases I have implemented a 5 second (5,000 millisecond) timer. After the user is at the main screen they select an option and the respected mp3 file would play accordingly. 

## Animal Sounds

This application I created with my daughter Chloe in mind. I kept the main activity pretty simple and straight forward. Click the buttons and the animal sounds for that animal will play.

See screenshots below:
