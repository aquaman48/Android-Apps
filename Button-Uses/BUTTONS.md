## Buttons

In this directory I was working with implementing a button. In the Youth Hostel application that button was used to show more information once clicked. There a lot of various uses we can have for a button. The main uses of the button that I worked through in this directory is on click it will open a new page like in the Youth Hostel app or it could be what starts doing the calculations to find a price of a ticket for a ferry tickets and have them displayed like in the Catalina Island Express app. 


## Youth Hostel App

Once the application is opened and running in the emulator the main screen will look like this:

Once the user clicks on the Hotel Information button they would then get redirected to the information page as seen here:
